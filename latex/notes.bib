	abstract = {We provide a computational model of semantic alignment among communicating agents constrained by social and cognitive pressures. We use our model to analyze the effects of social stratiﬁcation and a local transmission bottleneck on the coordination of meaning in isolated dyads. The analysis suggests that the traditional approach to learning—understood as inferring prescribed meaning from observations—can be viewed as a special case of semantic alignment, manifesting itself in the behaviour of socially imbalanced dyads put under mild pressure of a local transmission bottleneck. Other parametrizations of the model yield different long-term effects, including lack of convergence or convergence on simple meanings only.},

In settings where such social information is not known, this accommodation can be a useful cue for the missing information. This is especially important in web-based communication, where social dynamics are often ﬂuid and rarely stated explicitly. But connecting accommodation and social dynamics on the web requires accurate quantiﬁcation of the di↵erent amounts of accommodation being made.},

We focus here on “linguistic alignment,” changes in word choice based on others’ choices. Although linguistic alignment is observed across many different contexts and its degree correlates with important social factors such as power and likability, its sources are still uncertain. We build on a recent probabilistic model of alignment, using it to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. We model alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies. Our results show evidence of alignment, but it is primarily lexical rather than categorical. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that discourse acts modulate alignment substantially. This evidence supports the view that alignment is shaped by strategic communicative processes related to the ongoing discourse.},

We propose that participants use dialogue to coordinate two kinds of transitions in these joint projects: vertical transitions, or entering and exiting joint projects; and horizontal transitions, or continuing within joint projects. The participants help signal these transitions with project markers, words such as uh-huh, m-hm, yeah, okay, or all right. These words have been studied mainly as signals of listener feedback (back-channel signals) or turn-taking devices (acknowledgment tokens). We present evidence from several types of well-deﬁned tasks that they are also part of a system of contrasts specialized for navigating joint projects. Uh-huh, m-hm and yeah are used for horizontal transitions, and okay and all right for vertical transitions.},

	abstract = {Linguistic alignment between dialogue partners has been claimed to be affected by their relative social power. A common ﬁnding has been that interlocutors of higher power tend to receive more alignment than those of lower power. However, these studies overlook some low-level linguistic features that can also affect alignment, which casts doubts on these ﬁndings. This work characterizes the effect of power on alignment with logistic regression models in two datasets, ﬁnding that the effect vanishes or is reversed after controlling for low-level features such as utterance length. Thus, linguistic alignment is explained better by low-level features than by social power. We argue that a wider range of factors, especially cognitive factors, need to be taken into account for future studies on observational data when social factors of language use are in question.},

However, to fully capture changing linguistic usage, feature productivity needs to be taken into account as well.

The proposed measure has a simple predictive interpretation and can account for various confounding factors through proper conditioning. We revisit some of the previous studies that reported strong signatures of stylistic accommodation, and find that a significant part of the observed coordination can be attributed to a simple confounding effect—length coordination. Specifically, longer utterances tend to be followed by longer responses, which gives rise to spurious correlations in the other stylistic features. We propose a test to distinguish correlations in length due to contextual factors (topic of conversation, user verbosity, etc.) and turn-by-turn coordination. We also suggest a test to identify whether stylistic coordination persists even after accounting for length coordination and contextual factors.},

Particular configurations of personality traits (high self-monitoring, Machiavellianism and leadership, and low self-consciousness, impression management and agreeableness), combined with a low-power role, led to an increased likelihood of linguistic style accommodation. Further, greater accommodation by low-power individuals positively influenced perceptions of subjective rapport and attractiveness.

In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through smallscale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its eﬀects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset speciﬁcally developed for this task. This is the ﬁrst time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and veriﬁed) in a large scale, real world setting.},

In Study 1, greater LSM in transcripts of 40 speed dates predicted increased likelihood of mutual romantic interest (odds ratio = 3.05). Overall, 33.3\% of pairs with LSM above the median mutually desired future contact, compared with 9.1\% of pairs with LSM at or below the median. In Study 2, LSM in 86 couples' instant messages positively predicted relationship stability at a 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.95). Specifically, 76.7\% of couples with LSM greater than the median were still dating at the follow-up, compared with 53.5\% of couples with LSM at or below the median. LSM appears to reflect implicit interpersonal processes central to romantic relationships.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08473},
	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. This may present serious issues in subsequent analyses. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees. Based on our results, we conclude that the Leiden algorithm is preferable to the Louvain algorithm.},

The current experiment investigates this phenomenon, examining whether vowel spectra are automatically imitated in a lexical shadowing task and how social liking affects imitation. Participants were assigned to either a Black talker or White talker; within this talker manipulation, participants were either put into a condition with a digital image of their assigned model talker or one without an image. Liking was measured through attractiveness rating. Participants accommodated toward vowels selectively; the low vowels /æ {\textgreater}/ showed the strongest effects of imitation compared to the vowels /i o u/, but the degree of this trend varied across conditions. In addition to these ﬁndings of phonetic selectivity, the degree to which these vowels were imitated was subtly affected by attractiveness ratings and this also interacted with the experimental condition. The results demonstrate the labile nature of linguistic segments with respect to both their perceptual encoding and their variation in production.},

Specifically, we examined conversations within two native English talkers and within two native Korean talkers who had either the same or different regional dialects, and between native and nonnative talkers of English. To measure phonetic convergence, an independent group of listeners judged the similarity of utterance samples from each talker through an XAB perception test, in which X was a sample of one talker’s speech and A and B were samples from the other talker at either early or late portions of the conversation. The results showed greater convergence for same-dialect pairs than for either the different-dialect pairs or the different-L1 pairs. These results generally support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between phonetic convergence and interlocutor language distance. We interpret this pattern as suggesting that phonetic convergence between talker pairs that vary in the degree of their initial language alignment may be dynamically mediated by two parallel mechanisms: the need for intelligibility and the extra demands of nonnative speech production and pe­ rception.},

In the language sciences, a ubiquitous form of such repetition is structural priming, a tendency to repeat or better process a current sentence because of its structural similarity to a previously experienced (“prime”) sentence (Bock, 1986). The recent explosion of research in structural priming has made it the dominant means of investigating the processes involved in the production (and increasingly, comprehension) of complex expressions such as sentences. This review considers its implications for the representation of syntax and the mechanisms of production, comprehension, and their relationship. It then addresses the potential functions of structural priming, before turning to its implications for first language acquisition, bilingualism, and aphasia We close with theoretical and empirical recommendations for future investigations.},

This level of detail supports new research questions pertaining to the process (and challenges) of large-scale online collaboration.

First, we explore how a person’s conversational behavior depends on how they relate to the discussion’s venue. Second, we show that community moderation of toxic behavior happens at a higher rate than previously estimated. Finally the reconstruction framework is designed to be language agnostic, and we show that it can extract high quality conversational data in both Chinese and English.},

In order to provide an answer to this question, we assess Wikicussions from the point of view of dialog theory and identify characteristics specific to this webgenre. We then show that webgenres of this sort evolve into a state of multidimensional scale invariance that is simultaneously reflected on several syntactic and pragmatic dimensions – irrespective of the underlying topic being discussed and the composition of the underlying community of discussants. We also show that a system exhibiting multidimensional scale invariance interferes with thematic classification. The resulting confusability of the gestalt of Wikicussions in terms of their thematic provenance and their underlying participation structure is not just caused by the predominance of small units. Rather it also concerns larger or even largest Wikicussions. According to these findings, we distinguish two sorts of self-similarity of Wikipedia’s discussion space: horizontally, regarding thematically demarcated subparts of this space, and vertically regarding the gestalt of top-level sections in relation to Wikicussions. Our analysis is exemplified by means of the discussion space of the German Wikipedia. The results suggest that a quantitative discourse analysis of big dialogical data as provided by Wikicussions is a promising way to explain the peculiarities of this medium: it can be a starting point for a corresponding theory formation.},

Several psycholinguistics research programs have found what appear to be failures to adapt to partners in the early moments of processing and have used this evidence to argue for modularity in the language processing architecture, claiming that the system cannot take into account a partner’s distinct needs or knowledge early in processing. We review the evidence for both early and delayed partner-specific adaptations, and we identify some challenges and difficulties with interpreting this evidence. We then discuss new analyses from a previously published referential communication experiment (Metzing \& Brennan, 2003) demonstrating that partner-specific effects need not occur late in processing. In contrast to Pickering and Garrod (2004) and Keysar, Barr, and Horton (1998b), we conclude that there is no good evidence that early processing has to be be “egocentric,”“dumb,” or encapsulated from social knowledge or common ground, but that under some circumstances, such as when one partner has made an attribution about another’s knowledge or needs, processing can be nimble enough to adapt quite early to a perspective different from one’s own.},

	abstract = {Task-solving in dialogue depends on the convergence of the situation models held by the dialogue partners. The Interactive Alignment Model (Pickering \& Garrod, 2004) suggests that this convergence is the result of an interactive alignment process, which is based on mechanistic repetition at a number of linguistic levels. In this paper, we develop two predictions arising from the theory, along with two methods to quantify the known structural priming effects in the full inventory of syntactic choices found in text and speech corpora. (a) Under a rational perspective, we expect increased repetition in task-oriented dialogue compared to spontaneous conversation. We ﬁnd within- and between-speaker priming in a corpus of spontaneous conversations, but stronger priming in task-oriented dialogue. (b) The Interactive Alignment Model predicts linguistic adaptation to be correlated with task success. We show this effect in a corpus of task-oriented dialogue, where we ﬁnd a positive correlation of long-term adaptation and a quantiﬁable task success measure. We argue that the repetition tendency relevant for the high-level alignment of situation models is based on slow adaptation rather than short-term priming. We demonstrate that lexical and syntactic repetition are reliable and computationally exploitable predictors of task success.},

	abstract = {We present KenLM, a library that implements two data structures for efﬁcient language model queries, reducing both time and memory costs. The PROBING data structure uses linear probing hash tables and is designed for speed. Compared with the widelyused SRILM, our PROBING model is 2.4 times as fast while using 57\% of the memory. The TRIE data structure is a trie with bit-level packing, sorted records, interpolation search, and optional quantization aimed at lower memory consumption. TRIE simultaneously uses less memory than the smallest lossless baseline and less CPU than the fastest baseline. Our code is open-source1, thread-safe, and integrated into the Moses, cdec, and Joshua translation systems. This paper describes the several performance techniques used and presents benchmarks against alternative implementations.},

By analysing the use of a wide variety of parts-ofspeech and grammatical constructions, as well as various features related to Twitter and computer-mediated communication, we discover three dimensions of linguistic variation in this corpus, which we interpret as being related to the degree of interactive, antagonistic and attitudinal language exhibited by individual Tweets. We then demonstrate that there is a significant functional difference between racist and sexist Tweets, with sexists Tweets tending to be more interactive and attitudinal than racist Tweets.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown ﬁrst by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also veriﬁed on ad-hoc modular networks.},
