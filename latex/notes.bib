	abstract = {In conversation, speakers tend to “accommodate” or “align” to their partners, changing the style and substance of their communications to be more similar to their partners’ utterances. We focus here on “linguistic alignment,” changes in word choice based on others’ choices. Although linguistic alignment is observed across many different contexts and its degree correlates with important social factors such as power and likability, its sources are still uncertain. We build on a recent probabilistic model of alignment, using it to separate out alignment attributable to words versus word categories. We model alignment in two contexts: telephone conversations and microblog replies. Our results show evidence of alignment, but it is primarily lexical rather than categorical. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that discourse acts modulate alignment substantially. This evidence supports the view that alignment is shaped by strategic communicative processes related to the ongoing discourse.},

	abstract = {When people talk, they tend to adopt the behaviors, gestures, and language of their conversational partners. This “accommodation” to one’s partners is largely automatic, but the degree to which it occurs is inﬂuenced by social factors, such as gender, relative power, and attraction. In settings where such social information is not known, this accommodation can be a useful cue for the missing information. This is especially important in web-based communication, where social dynamics are often ﬂuid and rarely stated explicitly. But connecting accommodation and social dynamics on the web requires accurate quantiﬁcation of the di↵erent amounts of accommodation being made.},

	abstract = {Conversation is a joint social process, with participants cooperating to exchange information. This process is helped along through linguistic alignment: participants’ adoption of each other’s word use. This alignment is robust, appearing many settings, and is nearly always positive. We create an alignment model for examining alignment in Twitter conversations across antagonistic groups. This model ﬁnds that some word categories, speciﬁcally pronouns used to establish group identity and common ground, are negatively aligned. This negative alignment is observed despite other categories, which are less related to the group dynamics, showing the standard positive alignment. This suggests that alignment is strongly biased toward cooperative alignment, but that different linguistic features can show substantially different behaviors.},

	abstract = {Previous relationship research has largely ignored the importance of similarity in how people talk with one another. Using natural language samples, we investigated whether similarity in dyads' use of function words, called language style matching (LSM), predicts outcomes for romantic relationships. In Study 1, greater LSM in transcripts of 40 speed dates predicted increased likelihood of mutual romantic interest (odds ratio = 3.05). Overall, 33.3\% of pairs with LSM above the median mutually desired future contact, compared with 9.1\% of pairs with LSM at or below the median. In Study 2, LSM in 86 couples' instant messages positively predicted relationship stability at a 3-month follow-up (odds ratio = 1.95). Specifically, 76.7\% of couples with LSM greater than the median were still dating at the follow-up, compared with 53.5\% of couples with LSM at or below the median. LSM appears to reflect implicit interpersonal processes central to romantic relationships.},

	abstract = {The psycholinguistic theory of communication accommodation accounts for the general observation that participants in conversations tend to converge to one another’s communicative behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been empirically supported exclusively through smallscale or controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus, challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations, from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model accommodation and measure its eﬀects. We apply it to a large Twitter conversational dataset speciﬁcally developed for this task. This is the ﬁrst time the hypothesis of linguistic style accommodation has been examined (and veriﬁed) in a large scale, real world setting.},

In particular, we investigate the effect that an agent’s social network centrality has on the coordination exhibited in replies to their utterances. We ﬁnd that linguistic coordination is positively correlated with social network centrality and that this effect is greater than previous results showing a similar connection between statusbased power and linguistic coordination. We conjecture that the social value of coordination may reside in the wish to conform to the linguistic norms of a community.},

The proposed measure has a simple predictive interpretation and can account for various confounding factors through proper conditioning. We revisit some of the previous studies that reported strong signatures of stylistic accommodation, and find that a significant part of the observed coordination can be attributed to a simple confounding effect—length coordination. Specifically, longer utterances tend to be followed by longer responses, which gives rise to spurious correlations in the other stylistic features. We propose a test to distinguish correlations in length due to contextual factors (topic of conversation, user verbosity, etc.) and turn-by-turn coordination. We also suggest a test to identify whether stylistic coordination persists even after accounting for length coordination and contextual factors.},

	abstract = {Linguistic alignment between dialogue partners has been claimed to be affected by their relative social power. A common ﬁnding has been that interlocutors of higher power tend to receive more alignment than those of lower power. However, these studies overlook some low-level linguistic features that can also affect alignment, which casts doubts on these ﬁndings. This work characterizes the effect of power on alignment with logistic regression models in two datasets, ﬁnding that the effect vanishes or is reversed after controlling for low-level features such as utterance length. Thus, linguistic alignment is explained better by low-level features than by social power. We argue that a wider range of factors, especially cognitive factors, need to be taken into account for future studies on observational data when social factors of language use are in question.},
